This information is collected solely for app functionality and analytics purposes. The data is not linked to user identity and is not used for tracking. We comply with both Google Play's User Data policy and Apple's App Store guidelines regarding privacy and data collection.

## App Permissions

Depending on the specific app and platform, we may request the following permissions:

This identifier is not linked to your personal information and is used solely for authentication purposes. Not all of our apps require or support sign-in - please refer to each app's individual features and settings for specific authentication methods available.

## Data Storage and Security

All collected data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption and security practices. Most of your app data is stored locally on your device. Any data transmitted to our servers is encrypted during transmission and stored in secure cloud environments.
