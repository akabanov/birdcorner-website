Here are some tactics I used while suffering through the search for a new app name.
Some approaches work even better for naming a business, a website, or a product.

I'm writing this as a reminder to myself, 
and I hope it'll help somebody else.

Now, let's get to it.

## Name what it does

Come up with a good, simple, self-explanatory name.

I'm making [an app](https://numerista.app/) that teaches a technique for unlocking number memorization 'talent' you didn't know you had.
The app also helps to put this technique into practice in a few different ways.

It's OK to have a simple, self-explanatory name. Like Calendar. Or Camera. Or Calculator.
So I named it MemoNumbers. Inevitably.

Then start doubting yourself.
Because you know this name feels like a generic tool.

## Brainstorm with an expert

Talk to an AI. Explain what you're building.
Ask it to be your brand manager and brainstorm a name for you.

It'll tell you many things, but the most important is that a self-explanatory name is a poor candidate for a good brand.

Find out that you don't like the suggestions: they are already taken, they are off, too generic, or all at once.

Realize that you don't like your original name anymore either.

## Specialized AI name generator

There are plenty of name generators out there.
Cross your fingers and give them a try:

- [Shopify names generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator)
- [Design.com names generator](https://www.design.com/business-name-generator)
- [BusinessNameGen](https://businessnamegen.com/business-name-generator/)

They create some good stuff, but soon you realize that the generated names have the same issues: they are already taken, they are off, too generic, or all at once.

Note down the best few, just in case.

## Real randomness

Use a [random word generator](https://www.randomlists.com/).
Try random animals, things, lakes, and gods. Find nothing good.

Check out [existing brand names](https://www.randomlists.com/random-company) for inspiration.
Move on.

Try this quirky
[Game Studio name generator](https://alexvoelk.de/generators/game-studio/).
You'll hardly find anything good, but at least you'll have a lot of fun and some rest.

Remember checking the names in 
[Domain Sonar](https://domainsonar.birdcorner.app/)?
I'm mentioning this website for the second time because I made it. Just marketing, nothing personal.

## Faked randomness

By this point, you might've realized that the realm of **real** words is crowded and hostile.
Now it's time to turn your gaze to **fake** words.

Read through a few hundred [fake words](https://randomwordgenerator.com/fake-word.php).
Write down a hundred or so somewhat promising options.

Google them.

Toss them.

Sink deeper into desperation.

## A real name

Think about persons names. Or pet names.
Or geographic names (yes, I know I already mentioned the lakes).
If you think I'm joking, google Dave, Brigit, and Marcus apps.

It might be a good choice for a helper, a coach, or a companion app (health, habits, language learning, finance assistant).
But the trade-offs are uniqueness and searchability among some others.

Tip: you’re not restricted to your native language or country.
But be ready to explain your choice, so it won’t feel like cultural appropriation.

Interestingly, you can still trademark them.
Check for Alexander at USPTO, for example.
I was surprised to say the least.

## Scramble

By now, you probably have a list of promising names you have rejected for some reason.

Try scrambling them.
Scrambling is when you shuffle the letters in random order.
There is [a tool](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-scrambler.aspx) for this.

After wasting some more time, try UN-scrambling the names from your notes.
This is when you shuffle the letters to create other words.
There is [a tool](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/) for this too.

Maybe you'll come up with a good, clever anagram.

I haven't.

## Bits and pieces

Try combining words from your notes, but tear them down first.
Fortunately, you don't have to do it manually.
Here's a [good tool](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-combiner.aspx).

The most promising name I came up with for my app was "Nmory," from "Number memory."

Unfortunately, it was too close to a new tool from JetBrains.

The derivatives, like "Enmory" and "Tenmory", also failed the checks.

## User identity

Shift from the app's purpose to what identity it gives the user.

Try this:
can you come up with an app name suitable as a label for a person
using your app?

At some point I stopped thinking about "number memorization"
and started thinking about the kind of person who does it.

And that's how I _~~met~~_ ended up with [Numerista](https://numerista.app/).

## Conclusion

Please tell me in the comments if I missed some good approach here. This might help me and others save valuable time in the future.
