# How to name your app.

Here are some tactics I used to find a name for an app I'm building.
I'm writing this as a reminder to myself, 
and I hope it'll help somebody else. 

Some tactics work even better to name a business, a website, or a product.

> **Note**: google your candidates before you get too attached to a particular name.
>
> Check the names against existing top level domains.
> You can use [Domain Sonar](https://domainsonar.birdcorner.app/) for this.
>
> Search [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search)
> and [WIPO](https://branddb.wipo.int/en/similarname)
> for existing trademarks. It's cheaper to do it now than get
> a cease and desist letter when you are known and profitable.
>
> You'll find pretty soon that all good names are already taken.
> Many of them more than once. Good luck.

## DIY

_Come up with a good, simple, self-explanatory name._

I'm making an app that teaches a technique for unlocking your number memory you have no idea you had.
The app also helps to put this technique into practice in a few different ways.
[Here's the landing](https://numerista.app/), check it out.

It's ok to have a simple, self-explanatory name. Like Calendar. Or Camera. Or Calculator.
So I named it MemoNumbers. Inevitably.

Then start doubting yourself.
Because you know this name feels like a generic tool.

## Brainstorm with an expert

Talk to an AI. Explain what you're building.
Ask it to be your brand manager and brainstorm a name for you.

It'll tell you many things, but the most important is that the self-explanatory name is a bad candidate for a good brand.

Find out that you don't like the suggestions: they are already taken, they are off, too generic, or all at once.

Realize that you don't like your original name anymore either.

## Specialized AI name generator

There are plenty of name generators out there.
Cross your fingers and give them a try:

- [Shopify names generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator)
- [Design.com names generator](https://www.design.com/business-name-generator)
- [BusinessNameGen](https://businessnamegen.com/business-name-generator/)

It creates some good stuff, but soon you realize that the generated names have the same issues: they are already taken, they are off, too generic, or all at once.

Note down the best few, just in case.

## Real randomness

Use a [random word generator](https://www.randomlists.com/).
Try random animals, things, lakes, and gods. Find nothing good.

Check out [existing brand names](https://www.randomlists.com/random-company) for inspiration.
Move on.

Try this quirky
[Game Studio name generator](https://alexvoelk.de/generators/game-studio/).
You'll hardly find anything good, but at least you'll have a lot of fun and some rest.

Remember checking the names in 
[Domain Sonar](https://domainsonar.birdcorner.app/)
I mention this website the second time because I made it. Just marketing, nothing personal.

## Faked randomness

By this point you might've realized that the realm of **real** words is crowded and hostile and turn your gaze to **fake** words.

Read through a few hundred [fake words](https://randomwordgenerator.com/fake-word.php).
Write down a hundred or so somewhat promising options.

Google them.

Toss them.

Sink deeper in desperation.

## Scramble

By this time you probably have a list of promising names you have rejected for some reason.

Try scrambling them.
Scrambling is when you shuffle the letters in random order.
There is [a tool](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-scrambler.aspx) for this.

After wasting some more time, try UN-scrambling the names from your notes.
It is when you shuffle the letters to create other words.
There is [a tool](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/) for this too.

Maybe you'll come up with a good clever anagram.

I haven't.

## Bits and pieces

Try combining words from your notes, but tear them down first.
Fortunately, you don't have to do it manually.
Here's a [good tool](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-combiner.aspx).

The most promising name I came up with for my app was "Nmory," from "Number memory."

Unfortunately, it was too close to a new tool from JetBrains.

The derivatives, like "Enmory" and "Tenmory", have also failed the checks.

## User identity

Turn from the app purpose to what identity it gives to the user. "Vocalista" iPhone app is a great example.

My journey to better memory skills had started thanks to "The Mentalist" series.

And this is how I end up with [Numerista](https://numerista.app/).
